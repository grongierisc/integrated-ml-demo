            IntegratedML enables us to create, train and validate our model in 3 simple SQL queries. You will be able to see those queries in the <strong>Messages</strong> section of the side navigation bar.

                In the <strong>Model List</strong> tab, you will be able to consult the details of all already created models, as well as create new ones for the Titanic Passenger Dataset. <br>
                You will be able to select the value you want to predict. The most interesting one is obviously the "survived" value. You will be asked to give a name, and you will be able tp choose the variables with which the model will predict the value you asked for. Not choosing any will by default take all the variables except the one we want to predict.
            <p>
                Other than predicting if the passenger survived or not, it can be a fun experience training models to, for example, predict the sex of the passenger or the fare of the ticket (spoiler: it depends a lot on the class and the port of embarkment).

                It is also possible to delete models, or to purge them. Purging a model will erase all data from training runs, except for the last one. Deleting training runs data will also delete validation runs data. If you wish to kepp only the last trained model, this is the way!

                In the <strong>Train Model</strong> tab, you will be able to train those models, as well as see the details of the training runs already done. There you will have the choice of the provider you want to use:
            </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>AutoML: developed by InterSystems and housed within InterSystems IRIS;</li>
                    <li>H2O: an open-source AutoML interface.</li>
                    <li>DataRobot: you can use the free trial for 14 days, it will bring you great explainability, worth a try!</li>
                </ul>
            <p>
                An additionnal SQL query is done before training, to make sure that the ML Configuration is set to the good provider. <br>
                The dataset being quite small, training a model can take up to a minute.
            </p>

                A slider will enable you to select the percentage of the dataset you want to predict with. It will take the first lines, starting from 1.

                Finally, in the <strong>Validate Model</strong> tab, you will be able to validate your trained models. That is, you will have access to metrics calculated with the dataset (and the newly created passenger or not) representing the performances of the model. For that, you just have to click on the validation run you want and a dialog will appear, containing the metrics for your model.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here too, you will be able to select the percentage of the dataset you want to validate the model with. It will select the ones starting from the last line. With that, you will be able to train your model over a certain percentage of your dataset, and validate it on the rest of it (by default, the first 80% of the dataset for the training and the last 20% for the validation).
